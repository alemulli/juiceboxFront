# juiceboxFront

JuiceBox is a fullstack application made with:
- React.js 
- Express.js
- PostgreSQL

JuiceBox is a public message board web app. 

This project was meant to be primarily a backend learning experience, but teammmembers (Alexa Mullin and Timothy Brennan) also challenged themselves to create a functional frontend that tied into the backend database. 

Authentication was set up using JWT. 

We experimented with using different front-end design elements usch as implementing modal pop-up menus and animations.
